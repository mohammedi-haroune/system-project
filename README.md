# HomeWork TP System
this repository contains code, comments, answers and all related stuff to the homework of the system class made by **MOHAMMEDI Haroune** And **KADRI Adalan**.

# Structure 
Our goal is to make reading the content very easy and intuitive. to do so we adopt the following structure for our workflow : 

1. For each question create a branch named `exercice-number/question-number`.
2. Each branch must contain three directories named **code**, **out**, **report**.
3. The **code** directory contain all the `C` files and also header files such as `semaphore1.h`.
4. The **out** directory contain testing outputs and screen-shots.
5. The report directory contain all the question related stuff to include in the final report such as **latex** files.
6. Each branch must define it's own **README.md**
